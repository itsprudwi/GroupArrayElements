## Problem 
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.

Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal
to the remainder.

Example pseudo-code:

groupArrayElements([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3 );
> [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5 ] ]
